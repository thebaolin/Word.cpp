On the other hand, we denounce with righteous

indignation and dislike men who are so begui-

led and demoralized by the charms of pleasure

of the moment, so blinded by desire, that th-

  ey cannot foresee the pain and trouble that

  are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs

to those who fail in their duty through weak-

ness of will, which is the same as saying th-

rough shrinking from toil and pain. These ca-

ses are perfectly simple and easy to disting-

uish. In a free hour, when our power of choi-

 ce is untrammelled and when nothing prevents

our being able to do what we like best, every

pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain av-

                                       oided.


But in certain circumstances and owing to the

claims of duty or the obligations of business

 it will frequently occur that pleasures have

to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The

wise man therefore always holds in these mat-

ters to this principle of selection: he reje-

cts pleasures to secure other greater pleasu-

 res, or else he endures pains to avoid worse

                                       pains.
